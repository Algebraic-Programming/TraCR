# DetectR

DetectR is a user-friendly instrumentation library which can be activated/deactivated via a flag.

The core instrumentation library is currently a modified version of [ovni](https://gitlab.huaweirc.ch/zrc-von-neumann-lab/runtime-system-innovations/ovni).

In the future, DetectR could be extended to also include other backend instrumentation libraries.

The folder `examples/` shows examples on how to use this library.

We also included some python post-processing scripts for visualizations purposes (see `python_scripts/`).
