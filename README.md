# TraCR

**TraCR** (pronounced *tracer*) is a lightweight and user-friendly instrumentation library for tracing application behavior. It is designed to be easily toggled on or off at compile time, making it suitable for both development and production environments.

## Features

- **Lightweight integration** with minimal overhead when disabled.
- **Compile-time toggling** using `-DENABLE_INSTRUMENTATION`.
- **Optional debugging output** with `-DENABLE_DEBUG`.
- **Examples** provided in the `examples/` folder.
- **Post-processing scripts** for trace visualization in `python_scripts/`.

## Instrumentation Control

- `-DENABLE_INSTRUMENTATION` to enable instrumentation.
  - If undefined, all instrumentation calls become `void` (i.e. no performance impact).
- `-DENABLE_DEBUG` to enable debugging output from TraCR.

## Example Output

A sample trace generated using TraCR is shown below:

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Ovni (Dependency)

Clone this repo recursively as TraCR relies on [ovni](https://github.com/bsc-pm/ovni) as its core instrumentation backend. To install ovni:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Algebraic-Programming/TraCR.git
cd tracr

export prefix=$HOME/library/ovni  # or your preferred installation path

mkdir -p extern/ovni/build
pushd extern/ovni/build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$prefix
make -j$(nproc)
make install
popd
```

Add the following to your .bashrc to make ovni accessible:

```bash
# Ovni environment setup
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:$HOME/library/ovni/lib/pkgconfig
export PATH=$HOME/library/ovni/bin:$PATH
```

To verify the installation, navigate to the build directory:

```bash
cd tracr/extern/ovni/build
make test
```

### Step 2: Install TraCR

Once ovni is installed, build TraCR:

```bash
cd tracr
mkdir build
cd build
meson setup .. -DbuildExamples=false
```

## Trace Visualization with Paraver
To visualize traces produced by TraCR, install [Paraver](https://tools.bsc.es/paraver):

```bash
wget https://ftp.tools.bsc.es/wxparaver/wxparaver-4.11.4-Linux_x86_64.tar.bz2
```

Unpack and follow the installation instructions from Paraverâ€™s documentation.
